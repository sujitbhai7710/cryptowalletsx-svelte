    arc: [
      `Arc is different from most EVM chains because USDC pays for gas, not ETH. That means you're working with Circle's infrastructure from the jump. Gas costs basically nothing — fractions of a cent — so you can test DeFi flows without watching your balance drip away.`,
      `Since Arc is a testnet, the USDC here holds no real value. But that's the whole point. You get to build and experiment in an environment that mirrors how a USDC-native chain would actually work in production. Circle backs this chain, so the tooling and infrastructure are legit.`,
      `If you're coming from Ethereum or other L2s, the workflow feels familiar. MetaMask works out of the box. You deploy Solidity contracts the same way. The only real difference is what sits in your wallet and what you're spending on fees. Less worrying about gas means more headspace for actually building.`
    ],
    simplechain: [
      `SimpleChain does exactly what it says on the tin. It's a straightforward EVM testnet where you can learn the ropes without getting lost in complex tooling or niche features. The native token is SRW, and that's pretty much all you need to know to get started.`,
      `There's no flashy DeFi ecosystem here, no NFT marketplace, no governance token drama. Just a clean sandbox for deploying contracts, testing transactions, and getting comfortable with how EVM chains work. Sometimes that's exactly what you need — especially if you're just starting out.`,
      `The block explorer is simple, the RPC is simple, the whole thing is simple. And honestly? That's refreshing. Not every chain needs to be a sprawling ecosystem. Sometimes you just want to deploy a contract, call a function, and confirm it worked.`
    ],
    base: [
      `Base is Coinbase's Ethereum L2, built on the OP Stack. That sentence alone tells you a lot — it's got serious institutional backing, deep liquidity, and a user base that's already comfortable with crypto. Transactions cost under a penny and confirm in about 2 seconds.`,
      `The TVL speaks for itself: over $6 billion locked. That's not testnet money or speculative hype. That's real DeFi activity — Aerodrome, Morpho, Aave, and dozens of other protocols are live and thriving. If you're building on Base, you're building where the users already are.`,
      `What makes Base interesting beyond the numbers is the ecosystem play. Coinbase has 100M+ verified users. Base is positioned to be the on-ramp for a lot of them. The Farcaster integration, the smart wallet infrastructure, the developer tooling — it all points toward making crypto feel less like a hobbyist project and more like a product people actually use.`
    ],
    ink: [
      `Ink is Kraken's entry into the L2 space, built on the OP Stack like Base. That means it inherits the same fast confirmations and low fees, but with Kraken's ecosystem behind it instead of Coinbase's. The chain is live and operational, but it's still early days compared to more established L2s.`,
      `The DeFi ecosystem on Ink is thinner than what you'd find on Base or Arbitrum. Fewer protocols, less liquidity, smaller TVL. But that's not necessarily a bad thing if you're looking for early opportunities or want to be part of building out the infrastructure from scratch.`,
      `What Ink has going for it is Kraken's reputation and user base. Kraken is one of the oldest and most respected exchanges in crypto. If they push their users toward Ink — and they've signaled that they will — the activity could ramp up fast. Right now, it's a chain for people who like getting in early.`
    ],
    litvm: [
      `LitVM is an Arbitrum Nitro L2 running on Sepolia with zkLTC as its native token. If you've used any Arbitrum chain before, the developer experience will feel familiar. It's EVM-compatible, so your existing Solidity contracts and tooling work without modification.`,
      `The community around LitVM is small but active. You won't find the same level of DeFi activity or protocol diversity as on mainnet L2s, but that's expected for a testnet. What you will find is a functioning chain where you can test deployments, experiment with transactions, and get a feel for how L2s operate.`,
      `The zkLTC token is the native currency here, which gives LitVM a bit of a unique identity compared to the flood of ETH-denominated testnets. It's a solid choice for developers who want to test on an Arbitrum-style chain without dealing with mainnet costs.`
    ],
    seismic: [
      `Seismic is a testnet that does something most chains don't: encrypted smart contracts. The chain uses zero-knowledge proofs and encrypted computation, which means you can run contracts where the inputs and outputs aren't visible to everyone on-chain. That's a big deal for anything that needs privacy.`,
      `The trade-off? Gas overhead. Encryption and ZK proofs add computational cost to every transaction. You'll notice higher gas fees compared to a standard EVM chain. That's the price of privacy, and it's worth understanding before you start building.`,
      `Seismic runs on ETH as its native currency, and it's EVM-compatible at the core. You can use MetaMask, deploy Solidity contracts, and follow the same workflows you're used to. The encrypted computation layer is what sets it apart — if your use case needs confidential on-chain logic, this is where you experiment.`
    ],
    genlayer: [
      `GenLayer throws out the standard blockchain consensus model and replaces it with AI validators. Instead of deterministic execution where every node runs the same code and gets the same result, GenLayer's validators use AI to evaluate and agree on outcomes. That's a fundamentally different approach to how smart contracts work.`,
      `And here's the kicker: contracts are written in Python, not Solidity. If you're a Python developer who's been put off by Solidity's quirks, GenLayer is built for you. The "intelligent contracts" can make API calls, process natural language, and handle non-deterministic logic that would be impossible on a traditional EVM chain.`,
      `The Bradbury testnet is where all of this is being tested right now. The GEN token powers the network. It's experimental, it's ambitious, and it's not trying to be just another L2. Whether AI-driven consensus actually works at scale is an open question, but GenLayer is one of the few projects actually trying to answer it.`
    ],
    relay: [
      `Relay isn't a blockchain — it's a cross-chain bridge and swap protocol that connects over 80 different networks. You give it a source chain, a destination chain, and a token, and it figures out the best route. Sometimes that's a direct bridge, sometimes it hops through intermediate chains. The routing algorithm optimizes for price and speed automatically.`,
      `The volume numbers are real: Relay processes over $500 million in monthly transactions. That's not theoretical. People use this thing heavily, and for good reason — it's one of the fastest ways to move assets between chains without manually checking which bridge has the best rate.`,
      `For anyone managing positions across multiple chains, Relay is a core piece of infrastructure. The analytics here tell you not just what you've bridged, but how your cross-chain behavior compares to other users. Which chains you favor, which tokens you move most, and how your bridge activity has evolved over time.`
    ],
    jumper: [
      `Jumper is built on top of Li.Fi's aggregation technology. Instead of running its own bridges, it compares routes across 15+ different bridge protocols to find you the cheapest or fastest way to move assets between chains. Think of it like a flight aggregator, but for cross-chain transfers.`,
      `The Li.Fi API that powers Jumper is one of the most comprehensive bridge aggregation services in the space. It covers everything from big names like Stargate and Across to smaller, niche bridges. The comparison isn't just about price — it factors in speed, gas costs on both chains, and liquidity availability.`,
      `If you're someone who regularly bridges assets, Jumper's analytics give you a clear picture of your cross-chain activity. Which protocols you actually use, which routes are your go-to, how much you're spending on fees, and whether your bridge choices are optimal. It's a level of insight you don't get from just using the bridge UI.`
    ],
    dachain: [
      `DAC Quantum Chain is a testnet built around post-quantum cryptography. While most blockchains use elliptic curve signatures that quantum computers could theoretically break, DAC uses lattice-based and hash-based signatures that are designed to resist quantum attacks. That's not a theoretical concern anymore — it's a legitimate future-proofing play.`,
      `The chain is in its "Inception" phase, which means there's an active program encouraging early participation. You can claim testnet tokens, deploy contracts, and earn quantum badges. The DAC token is the native currency, and the whole ecosystem is geared toward building and testing quantum-resistant applications.`,
      `Should you care about post-quantum crypto today? Depends on your timeline. If you're building something that needs to be secure for decades, absolutely. If you're just testing contracts for fun, DAC still works as a functional EVM testnet — the quantum-resistant signatures are the differentiator, not the only feature.`
    ],
    doma: [
      `Doma is an L2 testnet with native cross-chain bridging built right in. Most L2s treat bridging as something you handle with external protocols. Doma bakes it into the chain itself, which makes moving assets between Doma and other networks feel like a first-class operation rather than a workaround.`,
      `It's EVM-compatible, so MetaMask works out of the box. No custom wallet setup, no weird RPC configuration headaches. You add the network, fund the wallet from the faucet, and you're off. The ETH-native environment means the learning curve is essentially flat if you've used any Ethereum L2 before.`,
      `The cross-chain bridge is the main draw here. If you're building an application that needs to interact with multiple chains, Doma's native bridging could save you from integrating third-party bridge contracts. It's still a testnet, so the bridge connects to other test environments — but the architecture is worth understanding if cross-chain is your thing.`
    ],
    robinhood: [
      `Robinhood's crypto arm built this chain as an Arbitrum Orbit L2 testnet. The significance isn't really in the tech — it's standard Arbitrum infrastructure — but in the potential distribution. Robinhood has 24 million funded accounts. If even a fraction of those users get exposed to on-chain activity through this chain, the numbers could be massive.`,
      `Right now, it's a testnet. ETH is the native currency, the explorer works, you can deploy contracts and send transactions. It's early. The ecosystem is bare-bones. But Robinhood didn't build this chain for fun — they built it because they're positioning themselves to be a major on-ramp for retail crypto users.`,
      `If you're thinking about where the next wave of crypto users might come from, Robinhood is near the top of the list. Getting familiar with this chain now means understanding the infrastructure before the crowd arrives. The testnet is the right place to start.`

  // Chain-specific FAQs
  const faqContent: Record<string, Array<{ q: string; a: string }>> = {
    arc: [
      { q: 'How do I get testnet USDC on Arc?', a: 'Head to the Circle faucet at faucet.circle.com. Connect your wallet, request testnet USDC, and it\'ll show up in a few seconds. Since USDC is the gas token on Arc, you need it for every transaction — not just for transfers.' },
      { q: 'Is Arc Testnet USDC worth anything?', a: 'No. The USDC on Arc Testnet has zero real-world value. It exists purely for testing. Don\'t try to sell it, don\'t try to bridge it to mainnet, and definitely don\'t treat it like real money.' },
      { q: 'Why does Arc use USDC instead of ETH for gas?', a: 'Because Arc is built on Circle\'s infrastructure with the explicit goal of making USDC the primary currency. Using USDC for gas means you\'re testing in an environment that reflects how a USDC-native chain would actually operate in production.' },
      { q: 'Can I use MetaMask with Arc Testnet?', a: 'Yes. Arc is EVM-compatible, so MetaMask, Rabby, and any other EVM wallet works. You just need to add the Arc network to your wallet using the RPC endpoint listed on this page.' },
      { q: 'How accurate is the wallet scoring on Arc?', a: 'The scoring uses on-chain data from the Arc block explorer. It reflects your actual transaction history, contract interactions, and DeFi activity on this specific chain. It won\'t include activity from other networks.' },
      { q: 'What does my rank (Bronze, Silver, etc.) mean?', a: 'Ranks are based on your total score out of 100. Bronze is 0-29, Silver is 30-49, Gold is 50-69, Platinum is 70-89, and Diamond is 90-100. Higher ranks mean more diverse and active on-chain behavior.' },
      { q: 'Does my Arc Testnet score affect anything on mainnet?', a: 'No. This is purely for tracking your testnet activity. Some projects use testnet activity as a signal for airdrops or early access, but there\'s no guarantee.' },
      { q: 'How often does the wallet data update?', a: 'Every time you scan an address, we pull fresh data from the Arc block explorer. There\'s no caching, so you always get the most current snapshot of wallet activity.' }
    ],
    simplechain: [
      { q: 'How do I get SRW tokens on SimpleChain?', a: 'Use the faucet or request tokens through the SimpleChain community channels. SRW is the native token — you need it for gas on every transaction.' },
      { q: 'Is SimpleChain suitable for production deployments?', a: 'No. SimpleChain is a testnet designed for learning and experimentation. Don\'t deploy anything here that you expect to be permanent or valuable.' },
      { q: 'What can I actually do on SimpleChain?', a: 'Deploy Solidity contracts, send SRW between wallets, and interact with contracts you\'ve deployed. It\'s a clean environment for testing without the complexity of a full DeFi ecosystem.' },
      { q: 'Does SimpleChain support ERC-20 and ERC-721 tokens?', a: 'Yes, since it\'s EVM-compatible, you can deploy and interact with standard ERC-20 and ERC-721 contracts. The block explorer tracks token transfers and NFT activity.' },
      { q: 'How is the wallet score calculated?', a: 'The score combines transaction count, contract interactions, volume, NFT activity, DeFi participation, wallet age, activity streaks, and token diversity. Each dimension uses a logarithmic formula so that early activity counts more than incremental gains at high levels.' },
      { q: 'Can I use Hardhat or Foundry with SimpleChain?', a: 'Absolutely. Point your Hardhat config or Foundry RPC URL to the SimpleChain RPC endpoint and you\'re set. Standard EVM development tools work without any modifications.' }
    ],
    base: [
      { q: 'Is Base a mainnet or testnet?', a: 'Base is a mainnet. Real ETH, real tokens, real value. Transactions cost actual money (though very little — typically under $0.01). Don\'t confuse it with Base Sepolia, which is the testnet version.' },
      { q: 'How does Base compare to Arbitrum and Optimism?', a: 'All three are Ethereum L2s built on the OP Stack. Base has the advantage of Coinbase\'s distribution. Arbitrum has more DeFi TVL and mature protocols. Optimism has the RetroPGF ecosystem. They\'re all solid choices — the right one depends on what you\'re building.' },
      { q: 'What DeFi protocols are available on Base?', a: 'Aerodrome is the dominant DEX. You\'ve also got Aave, Compound, Morpho, and a growing list of lending and yield protocols. The ecosystem is expanding fast with new protocols launching regularly.' },
      { q: 'How do I bridge assets to Base?', a: 'Use the official Base Bridge, or cross-chain aggregators like Relay or Jumper. The official bridge is the simplest option. Aggregators might find cheaper routes if you\'re bridging from chains other than Ethereum.' },
      { q: 'What does the wallet score tell me about my Base activity?', a: 'It gives you a snapshot of how active and diverse your on-chain behavior is. A high score means you\'re doing more than just holding — you\'re interacting with contracts, using DeFi, and staying active over time.' },
      { q: 'Does the score include activity from other chains?', a: 'No. The score only reflects your activity on Base. If you want a cross-chain view, check the Relay or Jumper analytics tools which aggregate activity across multiple networks.' },
      { q: 'Why is my transaction count different from what I see on Basescan?', a: 'We pull data from the Blockscout API, which may index transactions slightly differently than Etherscan-powered explorers. The core numbers should be consistent, but there can be minor variations in how internal transactions are counted.' }
    ],
    ink: [
      { q: 'Is Ink on mainnet?', a: 'Yes. Ink is a live mainnet L2 built on the OP Stack. Transactions use real ETH. It\'s not a testnet — your activity here has real economic weight.' },
      { q: 'How does Ink differ from Base?', a: 'Both are OP Stack L2s, but the backers are different. Base is backed by Coinbase; Ink is backed by Kraken. The tech is similar, but the ecosystems and target audiences differ. Ink is earlier in its development cycle.' },
      { q: 'What DeFi protocols are available on Ink?', a: 'The ecosystem is growing but smaller than Base or Arbitrum. You\'ll find some DEXs and lending protocols, but don\'t expect the same depth of options. This is a chain for early adopters right now.' },
      { q: 'How do I bridge to Ink?', a: 'Use the official Ink bridge or cross-chain aggregators. The official bridge connects through Ethereum mainnet, similar to other OP Stack chains.' },
      { q: 'What does the wallet score measure on Ink?', a: 'It tracks your on-chain activity specifically on Ink — transactions, contract interactions, DeFi usage, NFT activity, wallet age, and more. The score helps you understand how engaged you are with the Ink ecosystem.' },
      { q: 'Will Kraken reward Ink users?', a: 'There\'s no official confirmation of token airdrops or rewards. But Kraken has built this chain for a reason, and historically, chains backed by major exchanges have found ways to incentivize early users. That\'s speculation, not a promise.' }
    ],
    litvm: [
      { q: 'What is zkLTC?', a: 'zkLTC is the native token of the LitVM testnet. It has no real-world value — it\'s used purely for paying gas fees on the testnet. Think of it as play money for testing blockchain operations.' },
      { q: 'Is LitVM related to Litecoin?', a: 'The zkLTC naming is a nod to Litecoin, but LitVM is an independent Arbitrum Nitro L2 testnet. It runs on the Sepolia testnet infrastructure. The token name is branding, not a technical connection.' },
      { q: 'Can I deploy Solidity contracts on LitVM?', a: 'Yes. LitVM is EVM-compatible, so standard Solidity contracts, Hardhat, Foundry, and all your usual tools work. Deploy just like you would on any other EVM chain.' },
      { q: 'How do I get zkLTC tokens?', a: 'Check the LitVM community or Discord for faucet information. Testnet tokens are typically available for free through official channels.' },
      { q: 'What does my LitVM score tell me?', a: 'Your score reflects your on-chain activity on LitVM specifically — transactions, contracts interacted with, volume moved, NFTs collected, and DeFi activity. It\'s a measure of how active you are on this testnet.' },
      { q: 'Is LitVM a good proxy for Arbitrum mainnet?', a: 'Reasonably yes, since it runs on Arbitrum Nitro. The transaction flow, gas mechanics, and confirmation times are similar. But testnet behavior never perfectly replicates mainnet conditions.' }
    ],
    seismic: [
      { q: 'What are encrypted smart contracts?', a: 'Encrypted smart contracts allow you to run logic where the inputs and outputs are hidden from public view on the blockchain. Instead of all data being visible to anyone, ZK proofs verify the computation happened correctly without revealing the underlying data.' },
      { q: 'Why is gas more expensive on Seismic?', a: 'Encryption and zero-knowledge proofs require more computational work than standard transaction execution. That extra computation translates to higher gas costs. It\'s the trade-off for privacy.' },
      { q: 'What use cases need encrypted contracts?', a: 'Sealed-bid auctions, private voting, confidential DeFi positions, healthcare data processing, any scenario where you don\'t want on-chain data publicly visible. If you\'re building something where transparency is a bug rather than a feature, Seismic is worth exploring.' },
      { q: 'Is Seismic EVM-compatible?', a: 'Yes, at its core. You use MetaMask, write Solidity, and follow standard EVM development patterns. The encrypted computation layer is an addition on top of the standard EVM execution environment.' },
      { q: 'How does the wallet score work on a privacy chain?', a: 'The score uses publicly visible data — transaction counts, gas usage, contract addresses you\'ve interacted with. It doesn\'t peek into encrypted data. Your score reflects your visible on-chain footprint.' },
      { q: 'Can I use Seismic for production applications?', a: 'Not yet. Seismic is currently a testnet. The technology is promising but needs more testing before you\'d want to rely on it for anything with real value at stake.' }
    ],
    genlayer: [
      { q: 'What are "intelligent contracts"?', a: 'Intelligent contracts are GenLayer\'s term for smart contracts written in Python that are executed and validated by AI validators. Unlike traditional smart contracts that always produce the same output for the same input, intelligent contracts can handle non-deterministic operations like API calls, natural language processing, and AI inference.' },
      { q: 'Why Python instead of Solidity?', a: 'Because AI validators need flexibility that Solidity doesn\'t offer. Python is the language of AI/ML, has enormous developer adoption, and makes it trivial to integrate external APIs and AI models. It\'s a deliberate design choice to enable a different kind of on-chain computation.' },
      { q: 'How does AI consensus work?', a: 'Instead of every node running the same code and comparing results (deterministic consensus), GenLayer\'s AI validators each process the contract independently and then reach agreement on the outcome. This allows for non-deterministic results while still maintaining blockchain guarantees.' },
      { q: 'Is GenLayer live on mainnet?', a: 'No. The Bradbury testnet is the current testing environment. The GEN token is testnet-only at this point. Mainnet launch timeline hasn\'t been finalized.' },
      { q: 'What can I actually build with intelligent contracts?', a: 'AI-powered oracles, natural language processing on-chain, dynamic pricing based on real-world data, automated content moderation, sentiment analysis triggers — basically anything where you need AI to make a decision that gets recorded on-chain.' },
      { q: 'How reliable is AI consensus compared to traditional consensus?', a: 'That\'s the big question. Traditional consensus is deterministic and provably correct. AI consensus introduces probability and subjectivity. GenLayer\'s approach is novel but unproven at scale. The testnet is where you form your own opinion on this.' }
    ],
    relay: [
      { q: 'Is Relay a blockchain?', a: 'No. Relay is a cross-chain bridge and swap protocol. It connects to 80+ blockchains but doesn\'t have its own chain. Think of it as a routing layer that moves your assets between chains.' },
      { q: 'How does Relay find the best route?', a: 'Relay\'s routing algorithm considers price, speed, liquidity availability, and gas costs on both source and destination chains. Sometimes the cheapest route isn\'t the fastest, and vice versa. The algorithm balances these factors automatically.' },
      { q: 'What does the analytics score measure for Relay?', a: 'Since Relay is a dapp rather than a chain, the score measures your cross-chain activity — how many networks you\'ve used, bridge vs. swap ratio, total volume, success rate, and how diverse your chain coverage is. It\'s a measure of your cross-chain footprint.' },
      { q: 'Does the score include activity from chains I didn\'t bridge through Relay?', a: 'No. The analytics only capture transactions that went through Relay\'s infrastructure. If you bridged using another protocol, that activity won\'t appear here.' },
      { q: 'What does the success rate tell me?', a: 'Your success rate is the percentage of Relay transactions that completed successfully versus failed. A low rate might indicate you\'re dealing with chains that have frequent congestion, or you might be hitting slippage limits on swaps.' },
      { q: 'Can I see which tokens I bridge most often?', a: 'Yes. The token usage breakdown shows which tokens you move most frequently and in what volume. It\'s useful for understanding your own cross-chain behavior patterns.' },
      { q: 'How far back does the transaction history go?', a: 'We pull the full available history from the Relay API. Most transactions from the past several months should be captured, though very old transactions might not be available depending on API retention.' }
    ],
    jumper: [
      { q: 'How is Jumper different from using a bridge directly?', a: 'Jumper aggregates 15+ bridge protocols and compares their rates. Instead of manually checking Stargate, Across, Hop, and others to find the best price, Jumper does the comparison for you. It\'s like using a flight aggregator instead of checking every airline individually.' },
      { q: 'What is Li.Fi and how does it relate to Jumper?', a: 'Li.Fi is the aggregation protocol that powers Jumper. Jumper is the consumer-facing product; Li.Fi is the infrastructure layer. The API that drives our analytics comes from Li.Fi\'s data.' },
      { q: 'What does the analytics score measure for Jumper?', a: 'The score measures your cross-chain activity through Jumper/Li.Fi — how many networks you\'ve interacted with, bridge vs. swap activity, volume, protocol diversity, and success rate. It captures your multi-chain footprint specifically through the Jumper ecosystem.' },
      { q: 'Why might my Jumper transactions show as failed?', a: 'Common reasons: insufficient gas on the destination chain, slippage too tight, liquidity unavailable on the chosen route, or the bridge protocol itself having issues. Jumper aggregates other protocols, so failures can originate from any underlying bridge.' },
      { q: 'Can I see which bridge protocols I use most?', a: 'Yes. The protocol usage breakdown shows which bridges and exchanges handle your transfers. This is helpful for understanding whether you\'re consistently using the cheapest option or sticking with familiar names.' },
      { q: 'Does Jumper charge extra fees on top of the bridge?', a: 'Jumper may charge a small fee on top of the underlying bridge cost. The fee is transparent in the transaction details. The total cost (bridge fee + gas + Jumper fee) is what gets compared across routes.' },
      { q: 'How many chains does Jumper support?', a: 'Jumper supports 25+ chains through the Li.Fi aggregation layer. The exact number changes as new chains and bridges are integrated. Check the chain activity section of your analytics for the current list.' }
    ],
    dachain: [
      { q: 'What is post-quantum cryptography?', a: 'Post-quantum cryptography refers to cryptographic algorithms designed to be secure against attacks by quantum computers. Current blockchain signatures (like ECDSA) could theoretically be broken by sufficiently powerful quantum computers. Lattice-based and hash-based signatures used by DAC are designed to resist these attacks.' },
      { q: 'Should I be worried about quantum computers breaking crypto?', a: 'Not today, but the threat is real enough that NIST has been standardizing post-quantum algorithms since 2022. A sufficiently powerful quantum computer could break today\'s elliptic curve signatures. Nobody knows when that will happen, but chains preparing now are ahead of the curve.' },
      { q: 'What is the Inception program?', a: 'The Inception program is DAC\'s early participation initiative. You complete on-chain activities like deploying contracts and making transactions to earn quantum badges and testnet tokens. It\'s designed to bootstrap activity on the network while giving users a reason to explore the chain.' },
      { q: 'How do I get DAC tokens?', a: 'Visit the Inception portal at inception.dachain.io. The faucet there provides testnet DAC tokens for gas. These tokens have no real-world value.' },
      { q: 'Can I deploy standard Solidity contracts on DAC?', a: 'Yes. DAC is EVM-compatible at the application layer. The quantum-resistant signatures operate at the consensus level, so your contracts and transactions work the same way they would on any other EVM chain.' },
      { q: 'What makes DAC different from other quantum-resistant chains?', a: 'DAC combines lattice-based and hash-based signature schemes specifically for blockchain use. Most post-quantum efforts focus on TLS or general encryption. DAC is one of the few chains building this into the core protocol from day one.' }
    ],
    doma: [
      { q: 'How does Doma\'s native bridging work?', a: 'Doma has bridging infrastructure built directly into the chain protocol, rather than relying solely on external bridge contracts. This means cross-chain transfers can be initiated and tracked natively, with the chain itself managing the bridge state.' },
      { q: 'Which chains can Doma bridge to?', a: 'Currently, Doma\'s testnet bridge connects to other testnet environments. The exact list of supported chains can be found at the Doma bridge interface. Mainnet bridging capabilities will expand over time.' },
      { q: 'Is Doma EVM-compatible?', a: 'Yes, fully. MetaMask works out of the box, Solidity contracts deploy normally, and standard EVM tools like Hardhat and Foundry work without modification. The L2 architecture is straightforward if you\'ve used any Ethereum rollup before.' },
      { q: 'How do I get testnet ETH on Doma?', a: 'Use the Doma bridge faucet at bridge-testnet.doma.xyz. You can bridge testnet ETH from other networks or claim directly if the faucet supports it.' },
      { q: 'What does the wallet score tell me on Doma?', a: 'Your score reflects on-chain activity on Doma specifically — transactions, contract interactions, bridge usage, NFTs, and DeFi activity. Since Doma has native bridging, bridge transactions factor into the scoring differently than on chains where bridging is external.' },
      { q: 'Is Doma planning a mainnet launch?', a: 'Doma is currently in testnet. No official mainnet date has been announced. The testnet is the place to get familiar with the chain\'s unique bridging architecture.' }
    ],

      { q: 'Is Robinhood\'s chain live on mainnet?', a: 'Not yet. The Robinhood Testnet is the current public environment. It uses testnet ETH with no real value. Mainnet launch details haven\'t been announced, but the testnet infrastructure suggests they\'re laying the groundwork.' },
      { q: 'How is Robinhood\'s chain different from other Arbitrum Orbit chains?', a: 'Technically, it\'s not very different. It\'s a standard Arbitrum Orbit L2. The significance is in the distribution — Robinhood\'s 24M+ funded accounts represent a potential user base that most new chains can only dream of.' },
      { q: 'Do I need a Robinhood account to use the testnet?', a: 'No. The testnet is open to anyone with an EVM wallet. You don\'t need a Robinhood brokerage account to interact with the chain.' },
      { q: 'How do I get testnet ETH on Robinhood Chain?', a: 'Check the Robinhood developer documentation or community channels for faucet information. Testnet ETH is typically available for free through official channels.' },
      { q: 'Will there be a Robinhood token?', a: 'There\'s no official announcement about a token. Any claims about a Robinhood Chain token are speculation. Focus on the chain\'s functionality, not hypothetical tokens.' },
      { q: 'What does my wallet score mean on Robinhood Testnet?', a: 'The score tracks your testnet activity — transactions, contracts interacted with, volume, and DeFi participation. Since this is a testnet, the score is primarily useful for understanding your own engagement level and tracking your testing progress.' },
      { q: 'Why should I care about a Robinhood chain?', a: 'Because distribution matters more than technology in crypto. Robinhood has millions of users who already buy and sell crypto through their platform. If those users get on-chain access through this chain, the activity could be significant. Getting familiar now puts you ahead of that potential curve.' }

          The cross-chain analytics score measures how active and diversified your {config.name} usage is. It's not just about volume — it's about breadth. Someone who bridges small amounts across 10 chains scores differently than someone who moves everything through one route.
        </p>
        <p class="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed text-sm sm:text-base">
          The score factors in how many networks you've touched, your bridge-to-swap ratio, total and per-chain volume, success rate, and how recently you've been active. Each dimension contributes to the total, but the weighting favors diversity and consistency over raw numbers.

        <p class="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed text-sm sm:text-base">
          Your wallet score is calculated from 8 dimensions of on-chain activity. Each uses a logarithmic or square root formula — which means early activity moves the needle a lot, but you need increasingly more action to keep gaining points. This prevents whales from dominating the top ranks just by moving large amounts of tokens.
