                    At the core of our scoring is the formula: <code class="px-1.5 py-0.5 rounded bg-card/80 text-amber-400 text-xs font-mono">score = log₁₀(value + 1) × dimension_weight</code>. This means going from 0 to 10 transactions is worth roughly the same as going from 10 to 100, which is worth roughly the same as going from 100 to 1,000. This creates a natural curve where early activity is rewarded generously while preventing any single dimension from dominating the total score.

                    When you look up a wallet on {data.config.name}, you'll see a handful of metrics that describe your cross-chain behavior. Here's what each one means:
                  </p>
                  <div class="space-y-4 mt-4">
                    <div class="p-5 rounded-xl bg-card/60 border border-border/40">
                      <h5 class="font-semibold text-foreground mb-2">Total Transactions</h5>
                      <p class="text-sm">Total bridge and swap transactions. This is the baseline metric — it tells you how much cross-chain infrastructure someone is using. A wallet with 200 transactions is more active than one with 5, but raw count doesn't tell you about diversity or consistency.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="p-5 rounded-xl bg-card/60 border border-border/40">
                      <h5 class="font-semibold text-foreground mb-2">Network Coverage</h5>
                      <p class="text-sm">How many chains you've touched out of the total supported. 15 out of 80+ chains means broader ecosystem reach than 3 chains — even if the 3-chain wallet has more total transactions. Coverage measures breadth, not depth.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="p-5 rounded-xl bg-card/60 border border-border/40">
                      <h5 class="font-semibold text-foreground mb-2">Volume Metrics</h5>
                      <p class="text-sm">Total USD value of assets you've moved. We split this into bridge volume and swap volume so you can see whether you're mostly moving assets between chains or trading tokens on the same chain. A $10K bridge volume with $500 in swaps tells a different story than the reverse.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="p-5 rounded-xl bg-card/60 border border-border/40">

                      <p class="text-sm">How your last 7 days compare to your baseline. If you did 10 transactions this week and averaged 3 per week before, that's growth. If you did 1 this week and averaged 5 before, that's decline. Green means up, red means down — simple.</p>

                    When you look up a wallet on {data.config.name}, the dashboard shows several sections. Here's what each one tells you:
                  </p>
                  <div class="space-y-4 mt-4">

                      <p class="text-sm">Your composite score from all six dimensions. Scores typically range from 0 to 1000+. Because of the logarithmic formula, you don't need massive volume to score well — consistent activity across multiple dimensions beats high volume in a single category. A score of 400 with diverse activity is more meaningful than 600 from pure volume.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="p-5 rounded-xl bg-card/60 border border-border/40">

                      <p class="text-sm">Total transactions, sent vs. received, and patterns over time. We also show daily, weekly, and monthly averages so you can see your rhythm. If your weekly average is 3 transactions and last week you did 12, something changed — and you'll see it here.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="p-5 rounded-xl bg-card/60 border border-border/40">

                      <p class="text-sm">Your current {data.config.nativeCurrency} balance plus the total USD value of your portfolio (ERC-20 tokens and NFTs included where pricing is available). We also show token diversity — how many distinct tokens you hold — because holding 8 different tokens is a different profile than holding just the native token.</p>

                      <p class="text-sm">Sorted by type: staking, swapping, lending, providing liquidity, and bridging. For each category, you'll see how many interactions you've had and how many distinct protocols you've used. Using 3 lending protocols beats using 1 lending protocol 3 times — breadth counts.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="p-5 rounded-xl bg-card/60 border border-border/40">

                      <p class="text-sm">Your last 7 days vs. your historical baseline across all dimensions — interactions, contracts, volume, NFTs, fees, and DeFi. Green arrows mean growth; red means decline. If your contract interactions went from 2 per week to 8, you'll see a green indicator with the exact change.</p>
